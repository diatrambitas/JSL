  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of escalating oral doses of NLG802, an investigational agent intended to
      inhibit the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) enzyme and help the human immune system
      attack solid tumor cells more effectively.

    <description>Approximately 6 to 36 participants will be enrolled and treated at escalating doses of NLG802. Treatment may continue until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Successive groups of at least 3 participants will be evaluated during a 28-day window for DLTs, which will determine the enrollment and dosing for subsequent cohorts in the dose-escalation stage.</description>
